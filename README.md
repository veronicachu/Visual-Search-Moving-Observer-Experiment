### Overview:
Code used to produce the visual search stimuli and peripheral flickering stimuli (to produce SSVEP responses) presented in the publication ["Tracking Feature-Based Attention"](https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/aaed17) in the Journal of Neural Engineering. While the presented code is specifically used to produce Experiment 2 in the publication, Experiment 1 uses similar code.
